                    <h4>Swept Away is a post-apocalyptic exploration game set in the eroded remains of a once-vibrant coastal region. Decades after an ecological collapse, the climate has shifted into a relentless cycle of high winds and near-perpetual drought, transforming the landscape into a cracked and sun-scorched desert.
                        Life is hanging on by a thread — sparse, hardy plants rooted in sheltered crevices, small reptiles basking on the stone, and burrowing insects avoiding the blistering heat. These remnants are scattered and fragile, reminders of a world that once flourished.
                        The ocean still holds ancient ecosystems deep below the surface, but for humans it is a graveyard. Unpredictable, violent tempests turn the open water into a death trap, and the exposed coastline into a dangerous frontier of high waves and howling wind. Survivors have retreated inland, building massive, dome-like arcologies to shield against the abrasive storms and unending dryness.
                        From these sheltered sanctuaries, people venture out to scavenge, navigate, and adapt to the shifting sands — always aware that the further they stray toward the open coast, the more the elements will conspire to sweep them away.
